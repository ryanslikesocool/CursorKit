# CursorKit
Set cursors in SwiftUI on macOS.

CursorKit acts as a wrapper around `NSCursor` for SwiftUI, and supports all default cursor types.

## Installation
Install via the Swift Package Manager (`File/Add Packages...`)
```
https://github.com/ryanslikesocool/CursorKit.git
```
or as a package dependency
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ryanslikesocool/CursorKit.git", from: "1.1.0")
```

## Usage

```swift
import CursorKit
// CursorKit is now available to use ðŸŽ‰
```

### Basic
On a SwiftUI view, add the `cursor(_:)` modifier and pass in the desired cursor type from the `Cursor` enum.  The cursor will change to match the desired type when hovering over the view, and will reset to the standard arrow when not hovering.
```swift
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
    .frame(width: 64, height: 64)
    .cursor(.pointingHand) // <- Here!
}
```

For better compatability with custom views and stacks, apply the `contentShape(_:)` modifier before the `cursor(_:)` modifier.
```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "arrow.left")
    Text("Left and Right")
    Image(systemName: "arrow.right")
}
.contentShape(Rectangle()) // <- Set the hover test area to the entire stack, rather than just the visible parts
.cursor(.resizeLeftRight)
```

### Advanced
For custom controls, you may find that simply triggering a cursor on hover doesn't cut it.\
For these cases, you can use `push` and `pop` functions manually.
```swift
SomeView()
	.onChange(of: someCondition) { state in
		if state {
			// The push function is attached to the specific cursor
			Cursor.pointingHand.push()
		} else {
			// The pop function is static
			Cursor.pop()
		}
	}
```
Always make sure to balance push and pop calls to reduce the risk of issues.

## Note
CursorKit will compile on all platforms without errors.
This is a design choice made for ease of cross-platform development.
However, it will only make cursor changes on platforms that support AppKit.
